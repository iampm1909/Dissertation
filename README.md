# Dissertation
This Repo contains all the technical documents surrounding the systematic review on blockchain and ev charging infrastructure. It has the final dataset from Rayyan, as well as the visualisation codes and the analysis that supported it, the thematic synthesis and the corpus file for VOSviewer using which the visualisation was created keeping the threshold of minimum 10 occurences and manually selecting relevant keywords.
Please note that the codes were made early on in the project and the creative liberty has been taken to make changes to some numbers based on manual verification and include/exclude certain things to the final dissertation. However, as transparency was at the heart of this project, everything is dully reported. Thank you!
