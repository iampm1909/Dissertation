Title: Blockchain-driven parking reservation and recommendation system for shared spaces using multi-criteria decision-making with user feedback integration
Abstract: To address urban parking challenges arising from increasing vehicle ownership and limited space for new developments, we propose a blockchain-powered parking reservation system. This system enables private parking spaces to be shared during unused times, helping to alleviate issues such as illegal parking and congestion. It takes into account important factors like proximity to the city center, cleanliness, security, and the availability of electric vehicle (EV) charging points, which have become crucial with the growing adoption of EVs. Using a multi-criteria decision-making method, it ranks parking options based on user preferences, assigning the best match or recommending alternatives if the preferred spot is unavailable. Additionally, a Bayesian average rating algorithm updates parking ratings based on user feedback, improving the experience for future users. Blockchain integration ensures automation, reduces operational costs and guarantees transparency and immutability. This innovative approach maximizes the utilization of existing parking resources and offers a secure, efficient, and user-centric solution to urban parking issues while contributing to sustainable city development. © © 2025.

Title: A multi-faceted strategy for scalable, efficient, and grid-integrated electric vehicle systems using solid-state batteries and AI technologies
Abstract: The widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is a pivotal step toward achieving sustainable transportation and energy systems. However, several technological and infrastructural challenges hinder their scalability and efficiency. Despite advancements, current EV technologies are constrained by battery energy density, charging rates, and thermal management, limiting vehicle range and performance. Manufacturing limitations, supply chain issues, and charging infrastructure prevent large-scale implementation. The increasing demand for EVs also poses challenges to power system stability, particularly with the integration of intermittent renewable energy sources. This paper proposes a Multi-Faceted Method (M-FM) to address these challenges by integrating next-generation solid-state batteries with 40 % higher energy density, advanced battery management systems for optimal performance, and AI-driven predictive maintenance. This study aims to develop and assess a scalable, AI-augmented EV infrastructure model leveraging solid-state battery technologies for enhanced grid integration and sustainability. The proposed solutions include modular battery designs, automated gigafactories, and circular economy strategies for battery recycling to enable scalability. A smart grid integration architecture with bidirectional charging, dynamic load balancing algorithms, and blockchain-enabled energy trading platforms is introduced to transform EVs into grid-stabilizing assets. Experimental results show that the solid-state battery design achieves 500 Wh/kg energy density and 99.8 % faster charging. Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) integration can potentially fulfill to 96.3 % of a city's frequency control needs. Economic analyses indicate that these innovations could reduce the overall cost of EV ownership by 28 % compared to technologies. The study also emphasizes the need for legislative interventions, standardized billing, tariff reforms, and public-private partnerships, to accelerate implementation. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

Title: Integrating blockchain and iot with advanced predictive modeling for energy efficient urban transportation systems
Abstract: In a world that is rapidly urbanising and EV-dependent, the energy efficiency and sustainability of transportation infrastructures is a daunting challenge. It introduces the Blockchain-Based IoT Urban Transport Optimizer (BIUTO), a new approach that combines IOT, blockchain and predictive modeling for traffic management, EV charging efficiency, and building energy consumption. The framework aims to circumvent major drawbacks of current centralized architectures, such as data breaches, scaling, and inability to dynamically manage nested urban systems. The technology leverages IoT for real-time collection, Machine Learning Models (LSTM, Gradient Boosted Decision Trees, or GBDT) for predictive analytics, and blockchain for secure and decentralized data storage. The traffic subsystem helped reduce peak congestion by 23 % via real-time traffic flow prediction, and the EV charging subsystem increased energy efficiency by 15 %. The building energy efficiency subsystem reported high RMSE values for heating and cooling loads. The blockchain layer made data secure and transparent, alleviating issues with centralized system malfunctions. This work brings to the table a single, scaling approach to sustainable city transport based on energy efficiency, which will also serve as part of the sustainability agenda worldwide. The flexibility of BIUTO to integrate multiple urban subsystems represents an enormous step forward towards smart, low-carbon cities. Future efforts will include scaling the blockchain latency and scaling up the model to include renewable energy. © 2025

Title: A Blockchain-based cross-platform authentication scheme for EV aggregate charging platform
Abstract: With the development of electric vehicles, charging stations have garnered significant attention and progress. As a result, various charging platforms have emerged. However, due to the lack of shared charging information, issues such as low utilization of charging stations during peak hours and insufficient station availability have negatively impacted user experience. Inspired by the concept of an aggregation platform, we propose an aggregated charging platform for electric vehicles (EVs). However, challenges related to trust, such as single-point failures and the difficulty of achieving unified identity management, hinder the implementation of the aggregation model. To address these issues, we propose a blockchain-based EV aggregation charging platform model and a cross-platform identity authentication scheme. Leveraging the decentralized and highly secure characteristics of blockchain, we construct a decentralized aggregation platform and enhance the credibility and reliability of cross-platform authentication through smart contracts. Furthermore, we design a batch authentication scheme to efficiently handle a large number of authentication requests. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared to other schemes, our proposed approach improves authentication efficiency by 50–66.6%. © The Author(s) 2025.

Title: Using composable NFTs and blockchain for the creation of EV battery digital passports with sustainability and traceability features
Abstract: Greenhouse gas emissions and carbon footprints have surged dramatically, with the transportation industry being a major contributor. While the UN aims to adopt zero-emission vehicles by 2040, the demand for electric vehicles (EVs) raises sustainability concerns about sourcing earth metals for batteries. Digital passports have emerged to track a product's lifecycle, composition, certifications, origin, and recyclability. However, existing EV battery passport systems lack sufficient traceability, immutability, auditability, and are prone to manipulation due to their centralized nature. In this paper, we propose a decentralized blockchain-based digital passport for EV batteries using composable Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to ensure traceable, tamper-proof records that promote transparency across the supply chain. Our solution enables standardized data sharing and interoperability while integrating off-chain storage for efficiency. We evaluate four cathode chemistries using ten sustainability Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to compute an overall sustainability score per battery. We present a system architecture, smart contracts, and supporting algorithms are presented, with testing and validation in a simulated environment. A cost and security analysis confirms affordability and resilience against known attacks. Our approach offers practical value for sustainability assessments, regulatory audits, carbon footprint tracking, and circular economy initiatives by providing immutable, component-level provenance and real-time KPI updates. Limitations include simulation-based validation, lack of stakeholder testing, and scalability challenges in live deployments. While we address some of these, via Layer 2 scaling and modular smart contract design, further research is required to validate adoption in real-world EV supply chains. The smart contract code is made publicly available on GitHub. © 2025 The Authors

Title: Context-aware energy auctions on blockchain for mobile EV charging
Abstract: The rapid growth of EVs on the road has outpaced the expansion of charging infrastructure, highlighting the need for innovative solutions like Mobile Charging Stations (MCS). These on-the-go chargers are vital for regions with minimal infrastructure but require careful planning to maximize throughput and profit while ensuring customer satisfaction. One key challenge is customer no-shows, leading to resource wastage in terms of forced idle time at MCS charging points.

By integrating environmental factors like weather, traffic, and time with driver behavior history, the system predicts EV charging patterns, improving resource utilization. The proposed solution is presented as a zone-distributed framework that is deployed as a blockchain-based Decentralized Application (DApp). Experimental results demonstrate the approach's efficiency in reducing wasted time and maximizing revenue for MCS operations. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

Title: Optimal dispatching of electric vehicles based on optimized deep learning in IoT
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing trend in the utilization of Electric Vehicles (EVs), however with the increased usage of EVs, appropriate strategies for supporting the charging demands has not garnered much attention. The absence of adaptable plans in charging may result in minimized participation; further, the charging demands have to be addressed with utmost care for ensuring reliability and efficiency of the grid. In this paper, an efficient EV charging technique based on blockchain based user transaction and smart contract is devised. Here, charge scheduling is performed by acquiring the information the charging demand of the EV over Internet of things. In case the EV does not have sufficient power to reach the target, nearest Charging Station (CS) with the minimal electricity price is identified. The CS is selected considering various factors, such average waiting time, distance, power, traffic, and so on. Here, power prediction is performed using the Deep Maxout Network (DMN), whose weights are adapted based on the devised Exponentially Snake Optimization (ESO) algorithm. Furthermore, the efficacy of the devised ESO-DMN is examined considering metrics, like average waiting time, distance, and number of EVs charged and power and is found to have attained values of 1.937 s, 13.952 km, 55 and 2.876 J. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

Title: A Framework for Blockchain-Enabled Internet of Electric Vehicles Charging Station Sustainability Performance Evaluation
Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) charging stations (CSs) are increasingly prevalent due to the growing adoption of renewable energy. Solar CSs' main difficulties are energy efficiency, security, traceability, and sustainability. This article presents a novel blockchain-enabled EV charging framework that addresses these challenges using the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM), the Metamask wallet, and smart contracts (SCs). This article introduces solarcoins, a digital currency for trading solar energy, which reduces human intervention while fostering trust, transparency, and privacy among EV users. The proposed solution ensures secure communication between CS operators and EV users, enhancing both security and traceability. The proposed solution ensures secure communication between CS operators and EV users, enhancing both security and traceability. To quantify the sustainability and efficiency of the proposed system, the framework performances are tested and evaluated by varying numbers and types (Read, Write, and Transfer) of transactions using Hyperledger caliper and Go Ethereum. The overhaul Performance metrics were measured under varied transaction rates and control parameters by varying the number of validator nodes (1 node to 5 nodes), such as transaction latency, throughput, resource utilization, and so on. The performance of three major functions - open, query, and transfer - was recorded and analyzed. The results show that the query transaction is faster than open and transfer and the latency increases linearly with increased transaction rate. At 1000 transaction per second, the open function has a latency of 260.22 s, whereas the query function has a latency of 104.12 s and the transfer function has a latency of 345.73 s. The average memory usage for 1node-clique is 1224.0 MB, while it is 76.8 MB for 5node-clique. Results reveal that with an increase in the number of cliques (Validator CSs), memory utilization decreased linearly. This happens because all framework transactions are distributed across each EV CS network. The SCs deployment and operational costs were measured. Complexity analysis reveals that functions, such as getStation, getUser, getStationState, etc., exhibit constant time complexity O(1), while the registerUser and addStation functions have linear space and time complexity O(n). © 2014 IEEE.

Title: Toward Secured Smart Grid 2.0: Exploring Security Threats, Protection Models, and Challenges
Abstract: Many nations are promoting the green transition in the energy sector to attain neutral carbon emissions by 2050. Smart Grid 2.0 (SG2) is expected to explore data-driven analytics and enhance communication technologies to improve the efficiency and sustainability of distributed renewable energy systems. These features are beyond smart metering and electric surplus distribution in conventional smart grids. Given the high dependence on communication networks to connect distributed microgrids in SG2, potential cascading failures of connectivity can cause disruption to data synchronization to the remote control systems. This paper reviews security threats and defense tactics for three stakeholders: power grid operators, communication network providers, and consumers. Through the survey, we found that SG2's stakeholders are particularly vulnerable to substation attacks/vandalism, malware/ransomware threats, blockchain vulnerabilities and supply chain breakdowns. Furthermore, incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into autonomous energy management in distributed energy resources of SG2 creates new challenges. Accordingly, adversarial samples and false data injection on electricity reading and measurement sensors at power plants can fool AI-powered control functions and cause messy error-checking operations in energy storage, wrong energy estimation in electric vehicle charging, and even fraudulent transactions in peer-to-peer energy trading models. Scalable blockchain-based models, physical unclonable function, interoperable security protocols, and trustworthy AI models designed for managing distributed microgrids in SG2 are typical promising protection models for future research. © IEEE. 1998-2012 IEEE.

Title: BlockPPA: Blockchain-Assisted Privacy-Preserving Authentication for Cross-Domain Electric Vehicle Charging
Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) bring convenience to public transport while having the potential to increase energy efficiency. With the rapid growth of the number of EVs, cross-domain charging will become a strong demand. Despite massive research on EV charging, existing schemes can hardly meet the security requirements of privacy protection and access control for cross-domain scenarios. Meanwhile, centralized methods bring the single point of failure and data modification. The problem of designing a secure cross-domain EV charging scheme to simultaneously ensure decentralization, privacy and access control has not been studied and remains open. Therefore, in this paper, we design BlockPPA, the first blockchain-assisted privacy-preserving authentication scheme for cross-domain EV charging in order to achieve this purpose. Our scheme makes each EV obtain an attribute-based secret key, which is used to authenticate itself and also anonymously illustrate that it really satisfies a designated access policy when cross-domain authentication happens. Only authorized EVs satisfying the policy do they have the ability to charge. We design three smart contracts and exploit Fabric blockchain to record the domain's detailed information and the authentication record of each cross-domain access from an EV, while achieving the decentralized verification of an authentication request. The results of security and performance analysis show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed cross-domain authentication mechanism. © 2024 IEEE.

Title: Blockchain-Enabled Secure V2V and V2G Energy Trading for Carbon-Aware Internet of Energy (IoE) Networks
Abstract: As the Internet of Energy (IoE) network expands, integrating Electric Vehicles (EVs) into decentralized energy systems is essential for a secure and sustainable low-carbon future. However, EV adoption faces challenges such as limited driving range and inadequate charging infrastructure, particularly in rural and highway areas. This paper presents a blockchain-enabled framework for secure Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) energy trading, enhancing energy flexibility within the Carbon-Intelligent IoE. The framework optimizes trading strategies, ensures fairness, and stabilizes the grid by incorporating key game-theoretic models, Contract Theory, Bayesian Game Theory, and Evolutionary Game Theory, which are central to the proposed energy trading mechanism. Built on a lightweight Hyperledger Fabric architecture, the framework enables secure, transparent, and cost-efficient transactions. Performance evaluations show high efficiency, with transaction throughputs of 49.8 TPS for payments, 44.7 TPS for energy trades, and an average latency of 0.09–0.18 seconds. Resource utilization analysis indicates an average CPU usage of 23.76% and memory consumption of 169.5 MB during trade proposals. These results demonstrate the framework’s scalability, security, and robustness in enabling decentralized, carbon-intelligent energy trading within the IoE, advancing next-generation smart energy ecosystems. © 1986-2012 IEEE.

Title: Federated Learning in Vehicular Networks for Resource Management, Privacy, and Security: Challenges and Future Directions
Abstract: Federated Learning is presented as a transformative and efficient solution to the limitations of centralised machine learning practices in vehicular networks - offering enhanced privacy, efficiency and capturing the essence of distributed intelligence. Communication overhead from frequent model updates, data heterogeneity or non-IID data distributions degrading model convergence, privacy vulnerabilities such as model poisoning or gradient leakage, and high mobility leading to uneven participation of edge devices with inconsideration to system dynamics. To address these concerns areas such as Hierarchical Federated Learning architectures advanced resource management, bandwidth management via gradient sparsification, security enhancements using blockchain supported lightweight consensus and privacy-preserving techniques like differential privacy, homomorphic encryption were explored in detail which in turn gave rise to future research directions to be highlighted. The paper delineates a forward-looking research agenda that includes joint optimisation of resource allocation and addressing tradeoffs between energy, bandwidth, latency, and privacy. It also focuses on the development of adaptive, context-aware orchestration frameworks for dynamic structures, ensuring model interpretability for robustness and safety-critical applications, with particular attention to autonomous driving, traffic management, energy demand optimisation, and privacy concerns. The study finds that federated learning reduces communication overhead, preserves privacy, and supports applications such as autonomous driving, traffic management, and EV energy optimization. It also identifies blockchain, hierarchical FL, and differential privacy as key enablers while highlighting challenges in data heterogeneity, resource constraints, and real-time performance. © 2013 IEEE.

Title: Geographic Grid Segmentation for Mining Electric Vehicular Blockchains
Abstract: Charging of Electric Vehicles (EVs) from stationary roadside charging points (CPs) that are connected to a smart grid constitute as unique transaction events. These events can thus be verified by and stored over a distributed blockchain over the grid, where the smart CPs themselves act as miners. However, mining being an inherently resource intensive task, the grid is expected to remain fairly loaded due to a high EV charging density. Hence, towards smooth EV adoption, in this work, we propose to reduce relevant mining overheads for such a blockchain over smart EV-utility grid using geographic segmentation of the miner set. Depending on the physical locations of the CPs and their connectivity graph, we divide an initially unsegmented mining cluster into several smaller clusters geographically, where each cluster verifies only their local transactions. This significantly reduces important mining parameters per-transaction and per-block, while achieving parallelism of block generation across segments. We argue that for blockchain transactions like EV charging that are coupled to their geographic source locations, it is sufficient to have smaller independent, but parallel mining segments. Through a detailed analysis, we also prove that reducing the mining segment size does not necessarily compromise on the blockchain security. We corroborate our claims through extensive experimental results, where the proposed solution achieves an average improvement of 48% with respect to CPU cycles expended and mining energy consumed per block and 45% with respect to mining time per block with half-sized segments as compared to an unsegmented miner set. Our experimental results further prove that the proposed segmentation outperforms other geographic clustering such as K-Means clustering for blockchain applications. Additionally, owing to parallel block generation, we show that by segmentation, the mining energy required per block is reduced from 19 J to about 0.02 J over the same grid, providing a significant energy efficiency. © 1967-2012 IEEE.

Title: VETchain: A Scalable Vehicular Energy Trading Blockchain with Optimized Trade Matching
Abstract: Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) energy trading introduces a novel approach for electric vehicles (EVs) to engage in direct power exchange. This peer-to-peer energy-sharing model significantly enhances energy efficiency by allowing EVs with surplus charge to supply power to others, which is particularly advantageous during long journeys or in areas with limited charging infrastructure. V2V energy trading alleviates the pressure on public charging stations, optimizes energy distribution among vehicles, and diminishes grid demand during peak periods. Moreover, it is pivotal to the evolution of decentralised energy markets and the progression of smart grids, thereby facilitating the integration of renewable energy sources into the transportation sector. However, challenges persist in the practical implementation of V2V energy trading systems. The lack of standardised trading protocols hinders effective energy transactions among different EVs, leading to interoperability issues. Furthermore, the need for real-time data exchange exposes the system to cyber threats and data breaches, raising security and privacy concerns. To address these issues, this paper introduces a blockchain-based V2V energy trading system prototype that utilises EVs as mobile energy storage units. It employs a decentralised trading protocol for secure transactions and presents a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based optimisation model for dynamic trading matches, alongside a scalable blockchain prototype featuring a sharding consensus mechanism, demonstrating robust performance through empirical testing. © 2002-2012 IEEE.

Title: PCD-DB: Enhancing Popular Content Dissemination by Incentivizing V2X Cooperation Among Electric Vehicles Using DAG-Based Blockchain
Abstract: Collaborative content dissemination enables vehicles to directly access content from surrounding nodes through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technologies, such as Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) or Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication. This approach significantly alleviates the downlink traffic burden on cellular network base stations caused by repeated downloading of popular content while addressing security challenges in electric vehicle (EV) charging operations, such as payment fraud and data tampering. A key yet unresolved challenge in content dissemination and EV charging is incentivizing vehicles to participate in collaborative processes voluntarily. Existing incentive mechanisms mainly rely on centralized architectures, which are vulnerable to single-point attacks and trust issues in third-party platforms. To overcome these limitations, we propose the PCD-DB (Popular Content Dissemination using DAG-based Blockchain) scheme, which uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based blockchain to incentivize V2X collaboration for dual applications: improving content dissemination efficiency and ensuring secure EV charging transactions. Our novel framework establishes a decentralized incentive system where vehicles act as content propagators or charging service providers, depending on their service capabilities. We define the propagation and charging capabilities of vehicles and use contract theory to design hierarchical contracts tailored to heterogeneous vehicle roles. Numerical results show that our decentralized incentive mechanism significantly improves the efficiency and profitability of vehicle content dissemination while ensuring the security of electric vehicle charging transactions, outperforming existing benchmark methods. © 2025 IEEE.

Title: Optimum Resource Sizing and Operation in Virtual Power Plant Framework: VPP optimization and operation
Abstract: The optimum size and operation of virtual power plants (VPPs) are essential for sustainable green power systems in modern society. Renewable energy (mainly wind and solar) is intermittent and non-dispatchable. The aggregator of available energy storage systems and controllable loads, including heating, cooling, EV charging/discharging, etc., can mitigate those issues in the VPP framework and maintain system balance. The VVP platform's wind speed, solar radiation, and load demand are highly dynamic. Without intelligent coordination, it is impossible to determine the optimal size of the resources with minimum operation cost. An overestimate of resources suffers from unnecessary excess capital cost, which might not be feasible. On the other hand, an underestimate of resources builds an unreliable VPP. It is a multi-objective complex problem considering the minimization of capital and operation costs as objectives, subject to many constraints, including net zero emission. Moreover, an intelligent energy management system (EMS) is deployed considering present and near future dynamic forecasted demand profile, state of charge (SoC) of storage, and power availability from renewables for reliability, and maintains net zero energy and emission. All the dispatch and transaction communications in VPP are committed to using blockchain. This paper uses an intelligent multi-objective strategy to design and optimize a generalized VPP model. Historical wind speed, solar radiation, and load profiles over a long period are used as inputs for the model. An intelligent energy management system for the dispatch of resources is carried out. Results will show that the proposed method can build an effective VPP considering costs, emissions, efficiency, and reliability. © 2013 IEEE.

Title: TAURITE: Stackelberg Equilibrium in Blockchained Energynet Through Electric Vehicles
Abstract: The integration of Electric Vehicles (EVs) into the energynet, the network from power generation to EV charging station, presents a symbiotic relationship with potential benefits for sustainable and efficient transportation. However, the existing research has revealed challenges in maintaining an equilibrium between energy supply and demand, often resulting in underutilization or overutilization of energy networks. Blockchain technology has emerged as a promising solution to enhance transparency and secure decentralized energy distribution; however fails to connect the equilibrium in the presence of uncertainty of demand-supply and/or handling information cascading. In this paper, we introduce TAURITE (sTAckelberg eqUilibRium in blockchaIned energyneT with Evs), a novel blockchain-based energynet framework that explicitly leverages the Stackelberg model for energy flow equilibrium within EV interfaces. TAURITE employs Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE) to address demand uncertainty in dynamic vehicular environments. It also tackles information cascades' impact on energy distribution, demonstrating its ability to maintain equilibrium even in such scenarios. TAURITE introduces a multi-variate polynomial-based key generation process through the smart contract AVTAL and incorporates Proof-of-Energy-Equilibrium (PoEE) as an energy sector consensus mechanism. Experimental results show that TAURITE significantly improves throughput, latency, and energy efficiency, with an average 30% enhancement in these metrics. Notably, TAURITE ensures 100% allocation stability, even in the presence of information cascades, marking a substantial advancement in sustainable and efficient energy management within the evolving energynet-EV ecosystem. © 2000-2011 IEEE.

Title: Trustworthy V2G scheduling and energy trading: A blockchain-based framework
Abstract: The rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) and the deployment of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology pose significant challenges for distributed power grids, particularly in fostering trust and ensuring effective coordination among stakeholders. Establishing a trustworthy V2G operation environment is crucial for enabling large-scale EV user participation and realizing V2G's potential in real-world applications. In this paper, an integrated scheduling and trading framework is developed to conduct transparent and efficacious coordination in V2G operations. In blockchain implementation, a cyber-physical blockchain architecture is proposed to enhance transaction efficiency and scalability by leveraging smart charging points (SCPs) for rapid transaction validation through a fast-path practical byzantine fault tolerance (fast-path PBFT) consensus mechanism. From the energy dispatching perspective, a game-theoretical pricing strategy is employed and smart contracts are utilized for autonomous decision-making between EVs and operators, aiming to optimize the trading process and maximize economic benefits. Numerical evaluation of blockchain consensus shows the effect of the fast-path PBFT consensus in improving systems scalability with a balanced trade-off in robustness.

Abstract: Electricity markets are intricate systems that facilitate efficient energy exchange within interconnected grids. With the rise of low-carbon transportation driven by environmental policies and tech advancements, energy trading has become crucial. This trend towards Electric Vehicles (EVs) is bolstered by the pivotal role played by EV charging operators in providing essential charging infrastructure and services for widespread EV adoption. This paper introduces a blockchain-assisted secure electricity trading framework between EV charging operators and the electricity market with renewable energy sources. We propose a single-leader, multi-follower Stackelberg game between the electricity market and EV charging operators. In the two-stage Stackelberg game, the electricity market acts as the leader, deciding the price of electric energy. The EV charging aggregator leverages blockchain technology to record and verify energy trading transactions securely. The EV charging operators, acting as followers, then decide their demand for electric energy based on the set price. To find the Stackelberg equilibrium, we employ a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm that tackles non-stationary challenges through policy, action space, and reward function formulation. To optimize efficiency, we propose the integration of pruning techniques into DRL, referred to as Tiny DRL. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed schemes outperform traditional approaches. © 2024 by the authors.

Title: DEVS: Secure and optimal decentralized energy trading scheme for Electric Vehicle and Charging Station using game theory
Abstract: With the advent and popularity of electric vehicles (EVs), the intelligent transportation system has adopted them as an alternative to fossil fuel or gasoline vehicles owing to their benefits of reduced greenhouse gas emissions. However, it becomes critical to schedule the vast EVs at the charging station (CS) efficiently while maintaining security, privacy, and optimality during the energy trading. Therefore, we propose a blockchain and zero-sum game theory-based energy trading scheme, that is, DEVS, for optimal and secure EV charging at the CS. We incorporate the Interplanetary File System with the blockchain to ameliorate the cost-efficiency and reliability of EV energy trading. Furthermore, we implement the zero-sum game theory between players EV and CS to yield an optimal payoff based on pure and mixed strategies during the energy trading procedure. Moreover, we deploy and execute the smart contract (SC) of the blockchain-based proposed DEVS scheme in the Remix integrated development environment to secure EV energy trading transactions. Additionally, the security of the proposed DEVS scheme is checked and analyzed using a fuzzing-based Echidna tool for protected energy trading. Finally, the performance evaluation of the proposed DEVS scheme is analyzed using various standard metrics such as profit comparison based on strategies, energy price comparison, CS profit comparison for pure strategy (based on arrival time), convergence comparison, and profit (EV and CS) at saddle point and mixed strategy to avail preserved and optimal energy trading for EVs. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Title: EPDB: An Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Electric Charging Scheme in Internet of Robotic Things
Abstract: In recent years, electric vehicles (EVs) have emerged as a promising mode of transportation. With the development of Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) technology, charging stations are employing interconnected robots to charge EVs, automating the collection and transmission of user charging information. However, charging processes pose risks of privacy leakage to users, as malicious attackers could potentially exploit the collected charging information to infer the real identities and behavioral habits of EV users. Existing studies leverage the decentralization and anonymity of blockchain to achieve privacy-preserving charging management. Due to the increasing number of users and limited battery capacity, there is a large volume of charging requests demand to be processed. However, the consensus mechanism of blockchain limits the system throughput. Therefore, it is a challenge to preserve the privacy of EV users and simultaneously improve the system processing efficiency. To address these concerns, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving EV charging scheme (EPDB), which leverages decentralized identifier (DID) and Pedersen commitment scheme to achieve reliable charging reservations while hiding EV User's charging information. Additionally, we propose an efficient blockchain consensus protocol, which serves as the underlying storage for DID, thus significantly improving the system throughput. Furthermore, our proposed consensus protocol maintains high throughput even when encountering Byzantine attacks. Our theoretical analysis indicates that EPDB scheme effectively mitigate Byzantine attacks, preserve privacy and prevents deception of charging services, and our experimental results demonstrate the high efficiency of EPDB scheme. © 2024 IEEE.

Title: Energy Demand Forecasting for Electric Vehicles Using Blockchain-Based Federated Learning
Abstract: The widespread adoption of electric cars (EVs) can be attributed to their many advantages over conventional gas-powered automobiles. However, there may be difficulties in incorporating EVs into the grid due to increased energy demand and peak load. We propose a blockchain-based federated learning scheme using different linear regression algorithms for energy demand prediction for EVs. The information gathered from EVs is stored on the blockchain network. Only those with the proper credentials can decrypt the data from its encrypted storage. Data from EVs is utilized to train a machine learning model with the use of a federated learning algorithm. Each EV is used to train a model, and then the models' parameters are distributed throughout the blockchain. Our approach is innovative in analyzing of BCFL communications overhead and latency issues, while delving deeper into its dynamics to measure and reduce communication delays to maximize system efficiency. The implementation results verify the effectiveness of our system in anticipating EVs' energy requirements. For the training of the BCFL model, a huge real-world dataset was used from over 60,000 transactions at EV charging stations in Boulder city, Colorado. The results show that the framework is reliable, since all the models have R2 values above 0.91, which indicates a high degree of accuracy in predicting energy use. © 2013 IEEE.

Title: On the Utilization of Blockchain and Smart Contracts in Charging Coordination of Roadway-Powered Electric Vehicles
Abstract: With the increasing investments in on-the-move electric vehicle (EV) charging solutions and wireless charging lanes (WCLs), coordination of the energy requirements of mobile EVs becomes essential to ensure load balancing while maximizing demand coverage. This necessitates the development of online and mobility-aware algorithms for assigning EV-to-charging lanes. In this work, a decentralized, blockchain-based EV assignment and energy allocation system is presented. The objective of system is to coordinate the charging requirements of mobile EVs among the available WCLs within a network of EV chargers in an Internet of Electric Vehicles (IoEVs). This blockchain-based system offers higher security, transparency and immutability over traditional rule-based coordination schemes. It also offers an integrated end-to-end framework that handles user registration, authentication, lane activation and energy reporting. This is in addition to its main functionality of establishing a real-time and load-balanced EV-to-WCL assignment process that addresses the EV energy requirements within constraints of traveling distance and remaining EV energy. The proposed system is tested on the Ethereum blockchain and its security and transparency are both validated accordingly. © 2013 IEEE.

Title: Robust Vehicle-to-Grid Energy Trading Method Based on Smart Forecast and Multi-Blockchain Network
Abstract: In the present era, energy issues are a significant concern, and the energy trading market is the crucial sector to facilitate supply-demand balance and sustainable development. For better demand response and grid balancing, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology is rapidly gaining importance in energy markets. To narrow the gap between ideal V2G goals and actual applications needs, energy trading system has to overcome the challenges of over-centralized structure, inflexible timeline adaptation, limited market scale and energy efficiency, excessive feedback time costs, and low rate of economic return. To address these issues and ensure a secure energy market, we propose a decentralized intelligent V2G system called V2G Forecasting and Trading Network (V2GFTN) to achieve efficient and robust energy trading in campus EV networks. A multiple blockchain structure is proposed in V2GFTN to ensure trading security and data privacy between energy requests and offers. V2GFTN also integrates energy forecasting functions for EVs with a smart energy trading and EV allocation mechanism called SRET so that the EVs with driving tasks can supply their extra power back to the grid and achieve higher energy efficiency and economic profit. Through rigorous experimentation and compared with equivalent studies, V2GFTN system has demonstrated higher economic profit and energy demand fill rate by up to 1.6 times and 1.9 times than the state-of-the-art V2G approaches. © 2013 IEEE.

Title: Blockchain-Based Renewable Energy Trading Using Information Entropy Theory
Abstract: Renewable energy sources (RES) and electric vehicles (EVs) are widely recognized as primary ways to reduce carbon emissions and essential components of low-carbon power systems. However, both of them have strong uncertainties which bring great challenges to power transactions and the operation of power grids. This paper defines the uncertainty cost of wind power producer(WPP) in day-ahead(DA) market pricing based on information entropy theory for the first time and proposes a EV charging management strategy with DA contract. The constructed low-carbon emission electricity market(LCEM) quantifies the uncertainty cost and contracts the disordered charging of EVs. It reduces the uncertainty and ensures the balance of power supply and demand. In addition, the transaction between WPP and EVs is described as the Stackelberg game, and its communication network is constructed through a blockchain network to ensure transaction efficiency and privacy security. Experiments show that LCEM can accurately measure the uncertainty of wind power generation, increase the net profit for WPP by more than 2% when the prediction error is greater than 10%, and adopt EV contract charging management in the DA market to minimize charging costs. © 2023 IEEE.

Title: Privacy-Preserving and Traceable Blockchain-Based Charging Payment Scheme for Electric Vehicles
Abstract: With the rapid development of the global clean energy industry, the electric vehicle (EV) has gradually replaced the traditional fuel vehicle as a promising modern transportation tool due to its environmental friendliness and competitive prices. Its widespread adoption has led to a substantial increase in demand for subsidiary facilities, such as charging piles and stations. Despite the convenience and accessibility offered by charging services, the privacy of EV users may be compromised in the process, as malicious attackers can infer their true identities and consumption habits from service orders. Existing studies introduce blockchain technology into vehicle charging payment scenarios to protect the privacy of EV users. Unfortunately, it cannot achieve the desired full anonymity and may even hinder electricity regulators' investigation of suspicious transactions and entities. Therefore, designing a vehicle charging payment scheme that simultaneously supports privacy protection and traceability is a challenge. To address these concerns, this article proposes a privacy-preserving and traceable blockchain-based charging payment (PTB-CP) scheme for EVs. It can protect users' identity privacy and transaction unlinkability and track abnormal transactions or entities in exceptional circumstances. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of PTB-CP from both theoretical and experimental aspects. The analysis results demonstrate that our scheme can realize privacy protection, reliability and authentication, traceability, scalability, and high efficiency. © 2014 IEEE.

Title: Blockchain-based applications and energy effective electric vehicle charging – A systematic literature review, challenges, comparative analysis and opportunities
Abstract: Blockchain is a secure distributed system having a shared resource that enables participants to read and update a common shared ledger in a decentralized fashion. It provides an immutable and tamper-resistant distributed ledger with no central authority and no single point of failure. Consensus protocols are the backbone of any blockchain system as these protocols enable participant nodes to reach an agreement in a trustless environment. The performance of a typical blockchain system largely depends upon selecting the best-fit consensus protocol. Blockchain has influenced many application areas apart from crypto currencies such as document verification, copyrighting of art and craft, verification of counterfeit products and electric vehicle (EV) charging. This review paper discusses various consensus mechanisms in public, private, and consortium-based blockchains. The review study also covers the impact of consensus protocols on the performance scalability of the blockchain solution. The blockchain application area focused in this study is related to electric vehicle management and charging. The paper elaborates on how blockchain is enabling energy-efficient and secure EV charging. It also covers energy trading in a typical EV environment. © 2023

Title: A scalable, efficient, and secured consensus mechanism for Vehicle-to-Vehicle energy trading blockchain
Abstract: Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) energy trading has emerged as a promising scheme to relieve the load imposed on the grid without intermediaries. The blockchain has always been regarded as the most potential solution for addressing the security and privacy issues of the Internet of Electric Vehicles (IoEV). The consensus mechanism is the core of the blockchain, it determines the security, efficiency, and scalability of the system. However, consensus mechanisms currently employed in V2V energy trading are traditional algorithms, which are unsuitable for the IoEV due to their high computational power and communication overhead. Therefore, we are motivated to propose a Block Alliance Consensus (BAC) mechanism based on Hashgraph. BAC can maintain the high throughput of the Hashgraph, and it solves the problem that the Hashgraph cannot support the dynamic addition and deletion of nodes if it is directly applied to V2V energy trading. We utilize the sharding technique, and each shard generates a consortium blockchain in accordance with the characteristic of the IoEV. The centralized component is retained to ensure macroeconomic control by state and local governments. We design a cryptography-based leader election combined with a reputation incentive mechanism to fairly elect centralized leader committee and motivate honest electric vehicles (EVs). We implement the BAC consensus and V2V energy trading blockchain (ETB) on the Hyperledger Fabric. The performance and practicality of BAC and the V2V ETB are verified through experiments. © 2023

Title: Blockchain-assisted spent electric vehicle battery participation for load frequency control problems in interconnected power systems is resilient, low-carbon, and offers revenues to the operators
Abstract: Parked electric vehicles (EVs) participation is thought to be a low-carbon and resilient solution in addressing the load frequency control (LFC) problems in interconnected power systems (IPS). But this participation results in multiple issues such as trust, traceability, and transparency (3Ts) for EV owners in terms of financial compensation, battery effects, and range anxiety; early EV batteries end-of-life (EoL) management by recyclers; and burden on critical materials for new EV batteries manufacturing. Hence, to avoid the highlighted issues while addressing LFC, we propose a product life-extension circular business model and blockchainification of non-digital assets inspired spent EV battery (SEVB) buffer storage system. Two area IPS where areas 1 and 2 having a tie-line power agreement, SEVB storage system, particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based controller, and blockchain-based participatory smart contracts (BC-PSC) are modeled. Resilience Performance, Life Cycle Analysis, and Techno-Economic (RePLiCATE) approach is used for realizing the feasibility. Results showed BC-PSC protocols and PSO effectively obtained the controller's optimal parameters under disruptive scenarios ranging from 5 to 20%. The recovery times went from 18.60 to 46.43 sec. SEVB in LFC produces 18.71% less global warming potential than parked EVs. Revenues for SEVB owners were 122.27%, 100.22%, and 66.67% higher than cash spent on charging at off-peak, mid-peak, and on-peak, respectively. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

Title: Unleashing the circular economy in the electric vehicle battery supply chain: A case study on data sharing and blockchain potential
Abstract: Electric vehicles are perceived as a key technology to make mobility more sustainable, leading to a sharp rise in electric battery production and use. However, electric vehicle batteries are only a sustainable solution if they support decreasing the total impact of the supply chain, which makes circularity initiatives a key element in this transition. Currently, this is limited by the data sharing among actors in the supply chain on critical information needed to support a circular economy approach. In this study we explore how data sharing and information technology support the development of circularity in electric vehicle supply chains and examine the role of blockchain technology to address the circularity needs of battery tracking and capability sharing. To allow a comprehensive analysis, we conduct a case study in the electric vehicle battery supply chain, including companies from multiple tiers to capture all relevant perspectives. The results show that data sharing supports extended value chain activities, evolving from a linear to a circular supply chain perspective. It also indicates that blockchain technology supports removing existing barriers for a circular economy by facilitating transparency and traceability, especially for second-life applications beyond the dominant players in this industry. © 2023 The Author(s)

Title: A blockchain-based trustworthy collaborative power trading scheme for 5G-enabled social internet of vehicles
Abstract: Social Internet of Vehicles (SIoV) falls under the umbrella of social Internet of Things (IoT), where vehicles are socially connected to other vehicles and roadside units that can reliably share information and services with other social entities by leveraging the capabilities of 5G technology, which brings new opportunities and challenges, e.g., collaborative power trading can address the mileage anxiety of electric vehicles. However, it relies on a trusted central party for scheduling, which introduces performance bottlenecks and cannot be set up in a distributed network, in addition, the lack of transparency in state-of-the-art Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) power trading schemes can introduce further trust issues. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based trustworthy collaborative power trading scheme for 5G-enabled social vehicular networks that uses a distributed market mechanism to introduce trusted power trading and avoids the dependence on a centralized dispatch center. Based on the game theory, we design the pricing and trading matching mechanism for V2V power trading to obtain maximum social welfare. We use blockchain to record power trading data for trusted pricing and use smart contracts for transaction matching. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in improving social welfare and reducing the load on the grid. © 2023 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications

Title: A Secure Intra-Regional-Inter-Regional Peer-to-Peer Electricity Trading System for Electric Vehicles
Abstract: Peer-to-peer (P2P) trading is becoming a prominent topic and demonstrating the development trend of integration with other theories in order to achieve an efficient allocation of electricity resources in the electric vehicle (EV) market. In this article, we present a novel Secure iNtra-regional-Inter-regional P2P Electricity Trading System (SNIPPETS) for EVs. A trading information prediction model is constructed based on Ensemble Learning, upon which an intra-regional-inter-regional trading mechanism is proposed to find the optimal electricity allocation strategy, including the price and volume of electricity traded between EVs, in order to maximize the regional overall social welfare. In the intra-regional-inter-regional trading mechanism, multi-objective optimization is performed within each region to coordinately maximize the benefits of different types of EVs, followed by an investigation of pricing competition among neighboring regions based on a supermodular game. Furthermore, blockchain is introduced to support transaction payments and improve data security and privacy. Finally, the proposed SNIPPETS is validated through case studies. Compared to the traditional energy trading system and representative existing trading systems, SNIPPETS can effectively improve the regional overall social welfare and has higher computational efficiency. © 1967-2012 IEEE.

Title: Application of Blockchain Technology in Electric Vehicle Charging Piles Based on Electricity Internet of Things
Abstract: With the continuous development of urban intelligence, as traffic, power grids, and electric vehicles are new ideas to solve energy shortages and air control problems, they have received widespread attention from the society and strong support from the government. The charging pile is a key hub for data exchange and has typical characteristics of IoT terminals. However, the guidance of the grid connection of electric vehicles is not standardized, and the security and stability of the power grid will inevitably be affected. The blockchain has the characteristics that data is difficult to tamper with and decentralized. Based on these two characteristics, the information recorded by the blockchain is more authentic and reliable. This paper is aimed at realizing the global unified identification and management of large terminal equipment based on ubiquitous power Internet of Things equipment with the help of blockchain technology and at providing safe, efficient, and stable online management services for a large number of devices in the ubiquitous power Internet of Things. In this paper, we analyze the application possibility of blockchain technology in the current electricity market and apply blockchain technology to the electricity market to solve the drawbacks of the electricity market, as well as adding blockchain analytics to the renewable energy electricity market. The experimental data analysis shows that with the increase of the length of the blockchain, the blocking time of the new area increases correspondingly, but the overall performance declines slightly, so this scheme can meet the practical needs of a large number of concurrent access terminals in the ubiquitous power Internet of Things. It can be seen that the successful application of blockchain technology based on the power Internet of Things in electric vehicle charging piles has greatly improved work efficiency. © 2022 Haitao Liu et al.

Title: Blockchain Power Trading and Energy Management Platform
Abstract: In this study, artificial intelligence, the Internet of things, and blockchain technology were combined to develop a vehicle-to-everything blockchain power trading and energy management platform with the objective of enabling multi-level power transactions for electric vehicle charging stations in or between commercial buildings. The proposed platform considers green power transactions across microgrids, bidirectional power and green power charging and discharging transactions in microgrids, demand response bidding, and vehicle-to-vehicle emergency rescue charging. This innovative architecture operates smart contracts and distributed ledgers independently; uses smart contracts to handle bidding, matching, and settlement of the power trading platform; and simultaneously employs the cloud and local distributed ledger nodes to chain the detailed real-time transaction information and power data on the ledger. In this manner, the security and fairness of data can be ensured; furthermore, a large amount of chaining information can be processed, and the chaining latency can be shortened. In addition, the communication protocols are integrated through the artificial intelligence of things. An energy management system (EMS) is proposed, which can perform optimal charging and discharging scheduling according to the power transaction matching results and then control charging piles and energy storage system devices. It can reduce the operating cost of microgrids in commercial buildings, increase the efficiency of green power utilization, and reduce power loss. In this system, power transactions are automatically and simultaneously executed in the EMS to achieve real-time supply and demand balance of regional microgrids. © 2013 IEEE.

Title: Toward Privacy-Preserving Blockchain-Based Electricity Auction for V2G Networks in the Smart Grid
Abstract: With the development of electric vehicle (EV) technology, EV has become a key component in the future smart grid. Due to the sheer large number of EVs on the road, the emerging vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, which allows for two-way electrical flows between EVs and the power grid, is gaining traction. However, establishing a fair and private electricity exchange scheme has gradually become a critical challenge. The emergence of blockchain technology offers a novel approach for resolving this issue. In this study, we overview the opportunities and challenges of blockchain in the smart grid. Then, we provide a privacy-preserving blockchain-based electricity auction scheme for V2G networks in smart grid. In particular, we exploit PS group signatures to keep the privacy of EVs or charging stations and leverage blockchain to provide automated auction execution. With our mechanism, the identity of EV/charging station is conditionally protected. In case of an emergency, the trusted authority (i.e., the group manager) can open the identity. Meanwhile, we present the security analysis to prove our scheme's security. Finally, we implement the experiment to evaluate efficiency. The experimental results show that our proposal is efficient and suitable for V2G networks. © 2022 Weijian Zhang et al.

Title: A Robust Multi-Stage Power Consumption Prediction Method in a Semi-Decentralized Network of Electric Vehicles
Abstract: A Virtual Power Plant (VPP) balances the load on a power grid by allocating power generated by various interconnected units during periods of peak demand. In addition, demand-side energy devices such as Electric Vehicles (EVs) and mobile robots can also balance energy supply and demand when effectively deployed. However, the fluctuation of energy generated by renewable resources makes balancing energy supply a challenging goal. This paper proposes a semi-decentralized robust network of electric vehicles (NoEV) integration system for power management in a smart grid platform. The proposed approach integrates an aggregator with EV fleets into a blockchain framework. The EVs execute a multi-stage algorithm to predict the power consumption based on a novel federated learning algorithm named Federated Learning for Qualified Local Model Selection (FL-QLMS). From the evaluation results, the proposed system requires 35% fewer transactions in short intervals and propagation delays than the previous approaches and achieves better network efficiency while maintaining a high level of security. Moreover, NoEV achieves a 5.7% lower root mean square error (RMSE) than the conventional approach for power consumption prediction, which is a significant improvement. In addition, the FL-QLMS approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of robustness to client-side attacks. The evaluation results also show that the performance of FL-QLMS is not affected when 10% to 40% percent of the models are manipulated. © 2013 IEEE.

Title: A Secure and Efficient Energy Trading Model Using Blockchain for a 5G-Deployed Smart Community
Abstract: A Smart Community (SC) is an essential part of the Internet of Energy (IoE), which helps to integrate Electric Vehicles (EVs) and distributed renewable energy sources in a smart grid. As a result of the potential privacy and security challenges in the distributed energy system, it is becoming a great problem to optimally schedule EVs' charging with different energy consumption patterns and perform reliable energy trading in the SC. In this paper, a blockchain-based privacy-preserving energy trading system for 5G-deployed SC is proposed. The proposed system is divided into two components: EVs and residential prosumers. In this system, a reputation-based distributed matching algorithm for EVs and a Reward-based Starvation Free Energy Allocation Policy (RSFEAP) for residential homes are presented. A short-term load forecasting model for EVs' charging using multiple linear regression is proposed to plan and manage the intermittent charging behavior of EVs. In the proposed system, identity-based encryption and homomorphic encryption techniques are integrated to protect the privacy of transactions and users, respectively. The performance of the proposed system for EVs' component is evaluated using convergence duration, forecasting accuracy, and executional and transactional costs as performance metrics. For the residential prosumers' component, the performance is evaluated using reward index, type of transactions, energy contributed, average convergence time, and the number of iterations as performance metrics. The simulation results for EVs' charging forecasting gives an accuracy of 99.25%. For the EVs matching algorithm, the proposed privacy-preserving algorithm converges faster than the bichromatic mutual nearest neighbor algorithm. For RSFEAP, the number of iterations for 50 prosumers is 8, which is smaller than the benchmark. Its convergence duration is also 10 times less than the benchmark scheme. Moreover, security and privacy analyses are presented. Finally, we carry out security vulnerability analysis of smart contracts to ensure that the proposed smart contracts are secure and bug-free against the common vulnerabilities' attacks. The results show that the smart contracts are secure against both internal and external attacks. © 2022 Adamu Sani Yahaya et al.

Title: Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Fair Exchange Scheme for V2G Based on Blockchain
Abstract: With the fast development of the electric vehicle (EV) technology, EVs are expected to be the mainstream in future. The large number of EVs facilitate development of the emerging vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, which realizes two-way electricity flows between EVs and the power grid. How to achieve fairness and privacy for EVs during electricity/service exchanges remains a challenging problem for V2G. In this article, we propose a privacy-preserving fair exchange scheme V2GEx for V2G based on the blockchain. V2GEx is composed of an extended blockchain that supports zero-knowledge funds, a fair exchange smart contract based on the hashchain micropayment mechanism, and a privacy-preserving protocol for V2G. We further propose a simpler and more efficient scheme called Uni-V2GEx, which preserves privacy for only one party. We also provide a rigorous security proof under the universal composability (UC) model to prove V2GEx's security. To evaluate its efficiency, we implement V2GEx and conduct comprehensive experiments to test its performance in terms of computation cost and processing delay. The experiment results show that V2GEx is highly efficient in that verification of V2GEx transactions costs only 20 ms and the average transaction processing latency is around 6 seconds in a 200-node blockchain network. © 2004-2012 IEEE.

Title: Blockchain and MEC-assisted reliable billing data transmission over electric vehicular network: An actor - Critic RL approach
Abstract: Recently, electric vehicles (EVs) have been widely used under the call of green travel and environmental protection, and diverse requirements for charging are also increasing gradually. In order to ensure the authenticity and privacy of charging information interaction, blockchain technology is proposed and applied in charging station billing systems. However, there are some issues in blockchain itself, including lower computing efficiency of the nodes and higher energy consumption in the consensus process. To handle the above issues, in this paper, combining blockchain and mobile edge computing (MEC), we develop a reliable billing data transmission scheme to improve the computing capacity of nodes and reduce the energy consumption of the consensus process. By jointly optimizing the primary and replica nodes offloading decisions, block size and block interval, the transaction throughput of the blockchain system is maximized, as well as the latency and energy consumption of the system are minimized. Moreover, we formulate the joint optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). To tackle the dynamic and continuity of the system state, the reinforcement learning (RL) is introduced to solve the MDP problem. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the performance improvement of the proposed scheme through comparison with other existing schemes. © 2013 China Institute of Communications.

Title: The Blockchain Solution for the Security of Internet of Energy and Electric Vehicle Interface
Abstract: In this paper, an Internet of Energy (IoE) solution for providing optimal charging and control of resources in the era of electric vehicles (EVs) with energy trading and security is considered. A blockchain based security solution is presented by considering the IoE as a distributed energy system with internet of things (IoT). However, by inheriting the security concerns of IoTs, IoE also faces the security challenges and is considered here. Hierarchical key generation is used for cryptographic keys, based on lattice constructions. Along with a consensus tailored with Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), an additional smart contract is also applied for utilization of energy transfer. The presented solution provides transparency, reliability, availability and failure recovery inheriting from the blockchain aspects. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first attempt in this direction of IoE-EV interface solutions. The experimental results, comparative analysis and security validation affirm the superiority of the proposed solution over the existing approaches. © 1967-2012 IEEE.

Title: Blockchain-based peer-to-peer energy trading and charging payment system for electric vehicles
Abstract: The world is moving rapidly from carbon-producing vehicles to green transportation systems. Electric vehicles (EV) are a big step towards a friendly mode of transport. With the constant rise in the number of electric vehicles, we need a widespread and seamless charging infrastructure that supports seamless charging and billing. Some users generate electricity using solar panels and charge their electric vehicles. In contrast, some use charging stations, and they pay for vehicle charging. This raises the question of trust and transparency. There are many countries where laws are not strictly enforced to prevent fraud in payment systems. One of the preeminent problems presently existing with any of the trading systems is the lack of transparency. The service provider can overcharge the customer. Blockchain is a modern-day solution that mitigates trust and privacy issues. We have proposed a peer-to-peer energy trading and charging payment system for electric vehicles based on blockchain technology. Users who have excess electricity which they can sell to the charging stations through smart contracts. Electric vehicle users can pay the charging bills through electronic wallets. We have developed the electric vehicle’s automatic-payment system using the open-source platform Hyperledger fabric. The proposed system will reduce human interaction and increase trust, transparency, and privacy among EV participants. We have analyzed the resource utilization and also performed average transaction latency and throughput evaluation. This system can be helpful for the policymakers of smart cities. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Title: Blockchain-Based Energy Trading in Electric Vehicles Using an Auctioning and Reputation Scheme
Abstract: The massive adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has caused an increasing demand for electric energy to charge the vehicles. Efficiently managing energy trading between energy providers and energy consumers can lead to meet the high demand for charging EVs while reducing its cost compared to traditional power provided by the utility company. However, a large portion of the existing systems leveraged for trading energy between EVs are centralized and fall short in providing transparency, reliability, audit, security, and trustworthy features. In this paper, we propose blockchain-based energy trading using an auctioning and reputation scheme. We develop Ethereum smart contracts which enable owners of EVs to automatically request electricity to charge their vehicles in a reliable, cost-effective, secure, and trustworthy manner. The proposed approach ensures the lowest rate available by implementing a reverse auctioning scheme for fair competition between providers to provide the requested service at the lowest cost. The proposed solution enforces high quality of service through a reputation-based approach that quantifies the performance of the service providers and gives an advantage to more reputable providers. We present the implementation details of the deployed system on a test Ethereum blockchain platform. We perform system testing and evaluation to validate and assess the functionality and performance of the proposed solution. Furthermore, we present security and cost analyses to show the affordability, robustness, and practicality of the proposed approach. © 2013 IEEE.

Title: Blockchain for Electric Vehicles Energy Trading: Requirements, Opportunities, and Challenges
Abstract: Today's technologies, techniques, and systems leveraged for managing energy trading operations in electric vehicles fall short in providing operational transparency, immutability, fault tolerance, traceability, and trusted data provenance features.

Electric vehicle could be the major contributor to abbreviate the pollution level in a transportation sector. According to the Forbes report the ecumenical passenger electric vehicle demand expected to reach 15% in 2025, and 23% in 2030.

Title: A Secure and Decentralized Blockchain Based EV Energy Trading Model Using Smart Contract in V2G Network
Abstract: In this work, a secure and decentralized Blockchain based energy trading model for electric vehicles (EVs) using Smart contract that achieves Peer-to-Peer (P2P) transactions between EVs in Vehicle to Grid networks is designed. The traditional energy trading model is a centralized structure based on trusted third parties, and there may an issue of single-point failure and leakage of privacy. In this way, a blockchain-based framework offers a secure, efficient and transparent trading model. Initially, the participating EVs and aggregator in the trading process should register at the trusted authority. Once the registration is successfully completed, both EVs and aggregator authenticate each other mutually in an anonymous manner. Moreover, only authorized EVs (charging and discharging EVs) participate in the contrary auction mechanism to exchange power/money based on their demand. Simulation conducted for the proposed scheme shows that our scheme has high speed (i.e., less computational time and execution time) which improves the market efficiency. In-addition, the transactions are non tamperable, when compared to the conventional scheme. © 2013 IEEE.

Title: A Two-stage Autonomous EV Charging Coordination Method Enabled by Blockchain
Abstract: Increasing electric vehicle (EV) penetration in distribution networks necessitate EV charging coordination. This paper proposes a two-stage EV charging coordination mechanism that frees the distribution system operator (DSO) from extra burdens of EV charging coordination. The first stage ensures that the total charging demand meets facility constraints, and the second stage ensures fair charging welfare allocation while maximizing the total charging welfare via Nash-bargaining trading. A decentralized algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is proposed to protect individual privacy. The proposed mechanism is implemented on the blockchain to enable trustworthy EV charging coordination in case a third-party coordinator is absent. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. © 2021 State Grid Electric Power Research Institute.

Title: Blockchain Based Data and Energy Trading in Internet of Electric Vehicles
Abstract: The drastic increase in real-time vehicle generated data of various types has imparted a great concept of data trading in vehicular networks. Whereas immense usage of Electric Vehicles (EVs) as mobile energy carriers have supported distributed energy trading due to their bidirectional charging and discharging capabilities. The trustless environment of Internet of Electric Vehicles (IoEV), including fuel vehicles and EVs, encounters trading disputes and conflicting interests among trading parties. To address these challenges, we exploit consortium blockchain to maintain transparency and trust in trading activities. Smart contracts are used to tackle trading disputes and illegal actions. Data duplication problem occurs when a dishonest user sell previously traded data multiple times for financial gain. Therefore, data duplication validation is done through previously stored hash-list at roadside units (RSUs) employed with bloom filters for efficient data lookup. Removing data duplication at an earlier stage reduces storage cost. Moreover, an elliptic curve bilinear pairing based digital signature scheme is used to ensure the reliability and integrity of traded data. To ensure persistent availability of traded data, InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is used, which provides fault-tolerant and a reliable data storage without any single point of failure. On the other hand, the energy trading transactions among EVs face some security and privacy protection challenges. An adversary can infer the energy trading records of EVs, and launch the data linkage attacks. To address this issue, an account generation technique is used that hides the energy trading trends. The new account generation for an EV depends upon its traded volume of energy. The experimental results verify the efficiency of the proposed data and energy trading scheme in IoEV with the reliable and secure data storage. © 2013 IEEE.

Title: A blockchain-based configuration for balancing the electricity grid with distributed assets
Abstract: This paper explores a future perspective to foster the provision of balancing services to the electricity grid by distributed assets. One recent test case, initiated by the Dutch Transmission System Operator (TSO), was to operate an Electric Vehicle (EV) fleet on the automatic Frequency Restoration Reserve (aFRR) market, which entails fast and automated reserves. To achieve that in a decentralised, automated and transparent manner, the role of blockchain technology for this specific application is explored. We propose a novel configuration that can serve as a basis for deploying distributed assets for aFRR markets using blockchain or any alternative Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Automation can be achieved via the deployment of smart contracts, which also results in transparency in the system. The blockchain configurations are designed for three phases in the aFRR market, namely: (i) Operational planning and scheduling by a balancing service provider (i.e., formulation and submission of aFRR bid), (ii) Real-time operations (i.e., activation and measurements), and (iii) Verification and settlement (i.e., imbalance correction and financial settlement). The paper concludes that the scalability of distributed assets that can participate in the system, combined with the large transaction times and energy consumption of some consensus mechanisms, could put limitations on the proposed architecture. Future research should address benchmarking studies of other alternatives (e.g., DLTs, such as the ones based on directed acyclic graphs, and non-DLT solutions) with the proposed blockchain solution. © 2020, MDPI AG.

Title: On the potential of “Photovoltaics + Electric vehicles” for deep decarbonization of Kyoto's power systems: Techno-economic-social considerations
Abstract: To minimize the impacts of climate change, it is increasingly clear that global CO<inf>2</inf> emissions should be eliminated by 2050 and that leading low-carbon cities should reach net zero emissions by 2040. However, the precise pathways by which they can reach such ambitious goals have yet to be identified. As costs of photovoltaics (PV), batteries, and electric vehicles (EVs) are likely to keep falling, they can jointly play a key role for deep decarbonization. Here, we conduct a techno-economic analysis of a city-scale energy system with roof-top PV, batteries, and EVs for Kyoto City, Japan. We find that aggressive EV adoption and the use of EVs for electricity storage could help roof-top PV penetration in the city with substantially lower costs than just deploying PV and batteries alone or allowing EV to charge only. CO<inf>2</inf> emissions from vehicle and electricity usage in the city could be reduced by 60–74% if the entire current car fleet is replaced by EVs while also reducing energy costs by 22–37% by 2030. The largest challenge of a city-wide “PV + EV” system (named as “Solar-EV city”) is its implementation. We explore how it could be realized in Kyoto through peer-to-peer (P2P) power trading/blockchain technology initially on a community scale as smart microgrids, then gradually expanding/converging into a city-wide. For the transition to decentralized power systems, citizen's decision-making process is one of the keys to overcome social, institutional, and regulatory barriers. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

Title: Scheduling charging of electric vehicles in a secured manner by emphasizing cost minimization using blockchain technology and IPFS
Abstract: In this work, Electric Vehicles (EVs) are charged using a new and improved charging mechanism called the Mobile-Vehicle-to-Vehicle (M2V) charging strategy. It is further compared with conventional Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Grid-to-Vehicle (G2V) charging strategies. In the proposed work, the charging of vehicles is done in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) manner; the vehicles are charged using Charging Stations (CSs) or Mobile Vehicles (MVs) in the absence of a central entity. CSs are fixed entities situated at certain locations and act as charge suppliers, whereas MVs act as prosumers, which have the capability of charging themselves and also other vehicles. In the proposed system, blockchain technology is used to tackle the issues related with existing systems, such as privacy, security, lack of trust, etc., and also to promote transparency, data immutability, and a tamper-proof nature. Moreover, to store the data related to traffic, roads, and weather conditions, a centralized entity, i.e., Transport System Information Unit (TSIU), is used. It helps in reducing the road congestion and avoids roadside accidents. In the TSIU, an Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) is used to store the data in a secured manner after removing the data's redundancy through data filtration. Furthermore, four different types of costs are calculated mathematically, which ultimately contribute towards calculating the total charging cost. The shortest distance between a vehicle and the charging entities is calculated using the Great-Circle Distance formula. Moving on, both the time taken to traverse this shortest distance and the time to charge the vehicles are calculated using real-time data of four EVs. Location privacy is also proposed in this work to provide privacy to vehicle users. The power flow and the related energy losses for the above-mentioned charging strategies are also discussed in this work. An incentive provisioning mechanism is also proposed on the basis of timely delivery of credible messages, which further promotes users' participation. In the end, simulations are performed and results are obtained that prove the efficiency of the proposed work, as compared to conventional techniques, in minimizing the EVs' charging cost, time, and distance. © 2020 by the authors.

Title: Blockchain IoT for smart electric vehicles battery management
Abstract: Electric Vehicles (EVs) have generated a lot of interest in recent years, due to the advances in battery life and low pollution. Similarly, the expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) allowed more and more devices to be interconnected. One major problem EVs face today is the limited range of the battery and the limited number of charging or battery swapping stations. A solution is to not only build the necessary infrastructure, but also to be able to correctly estimate the remaining power using an efficient battery management system (BMS). For some EVs, battery swapping can also be an option, either at registered stations, or even directly from other EV drivers. Thus, a network of EV information is required, so that a successful battery charge or swap can be made available for drivers. In this paper two blockchain implementations for an EV BMS are presented, using blockchain as the network and data layer of the application. The first implementation uses Ethereum as the blockchain framework for developing smart contracts, while the second uses a directed acyclic graph (DAG), on top of the IOTA tangle. The two approaches are implemented and compared, demonstrating that both platforms can provide a viable solution for an efficient, semi-decentralized, data-driven BMS. © 2020 by the authors.

Title: An Iterative Two-Layer Optimization Charging and Discharging Trading Scheme for Electric Vehicle Using Consortium Blockchain
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of hierarchical and zonal scheduling and proposes an iterative two-layer model to optimize the charging and discharging trading of electric vehicles (EVs), so as to minimize the overall load variance of the distribution network under the constraints of power flow and vehicle travel demand. In order to solve the mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem that exists in this model, an improved heuristic algorithm, the adaptive inertia weight krill herd (KH) algorithm is proposed. In addition, we design a decentralized trading architecture and related electricity trading process based on the consortium blockchain to ensure the security and privacy of two-way electricity trading between EVs and the smart grid. The IEEE nodes based simulation experiment shows that our scheme can effectively smooth power load fluctuations, and the improved KH algorithm can effectively improve the efficiency of model solving. Security analysis qualitatively proves that our scheme can ensure the security and privacy-preserving of electricity trading. Finally, our scheme is implemented in the Hyperledger Fabric to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness. © 2010-2012 IEEE.

Title: A secure charging scheme for electric vehicles with smart communities in energy blockchain
Abstract: The smart community (SC), as an important part of the Internet of Energy (IoE), can facilitate integration of distributed renewable energy sources and electric vehicles (EVs) in the smart grid. However, due to the potential security and privacy issues caused by untrusted and opaque energy markets, it becomes a great challenge to optimally schedule the charging behaviors of EVs with distinct energy consumption preferences in SC. In this paper, we propose a contract-based energy blockchain for secure EV charging in SC. First, a permissioned energy blockchain system is introduced to implement secure charging services for EVs with the execution of smart contracts. Second, a reputation-based delegated Byzantine fault tolerance consensus algorithm is proposed to efficiently achieve the consensus in the permissioned blockchain. Third, based on the contract theory, the optimal contracts are analyzed and designed to satisfy EVs' individual needs for energy sources while maximizing the operator's utility. Furthermore, a novel energy allocation mechanism is proposed to allocate the limited renewable energy for EVs. Finally, extensive numerical results are carried out to evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme through comparison with other conventional schemes. © 2014 IEEE.

Title: Processing Electric Vehicle Charging Transactions in a Blockchain-based Information System Emergent Research Forum (ERF)
Abstract: Electromobility, electric vehicles (EVs) and charging infrastructure are major building blocks for a sustainable energy future. With the emergence of sustainable IS topics, energy informatics as the comprising research discipline receives increasing attention. One of the most contemporary research areas in this context is the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and their integration into the smart power grid of the future. Blockchain is a promising technology to complement lack in charging infrastructure by disrupting existing business models and enabling peer-to-peer sharing of charging stations (CSs). In this paper we investigate how to store and validate EV charging-related data on blockchain and how to process EV charging payment transactions in a blockchain-based IS. Within the ongoing research activity, we evaluate blockchain technologies regarding their applicability for this scenario. Further we implement the presented decentralized app (dApp) design and its smart contracts as a proof-of-concept for the technical feasibility of the solution, considering factors such as interoperability, data storage, trust and scalability.

Title: A Blockchain-Based Smart Contractual Framework for the Electric Vehicle Charging Ecosystem
Abstract: The impending adoption of electric vehicles is rapidly increasing the complexity of the charging process management for the various stakeholders of the EV charging ecosystem. These stakeholders need to cooperate in exchanging metering, billing, and other sensitive and private data required for the provision of EV charging services. Thus, secure, transparent, and reliable data communication networks must be established to enable efficient interaction among the different stakeholders regarding identity and charging management, along with the session settlement and billing processes.        Blockchain is a distributed, digital transaction technology that allows securely exchanging and storing data, as well as executing smart contracts in peer-to-peer networks amongst different entities without established trusted relationships. These smart contracts may holistically describe the relationships between the different entities, as well as the rules of their interaction. Additionally, blockchain technology has the potential to ensure the integrity, reliability, and efficiency of the established ecosystem, strengthen cybersecurity, protect privacy, and minimize transaction costs by applying sophisticated cryptographic techniques.        This paper provides an overview of how blockchain technology could transform and improve an operational EV charging management network and proposes a blockchain-based framework that is suitable for the electric vehicle charging ecosystem.

Title: Electric vehicle shared charging pile management system based on energy blockchain
Abstract: Aiming at the problems of insecure user data in electric vehicle charging piles and easy waste of charging pile resources, an electric vehicle charging pile shared charging pile management system based on energy blockchain is proposed. The blockchain has the characteristics of decentralization, smart contracts, and openness and transparency, and uses its characteristics to construct a charging alliance chain algorithm for electric vehicle sharing and charging. Through the Kanonymity model, the data of users, charging pile operators and managers are unified, and a management model of electric vehicle shared charging piles based on energy blockchain is established. The test results show that the electric vehicle shared charging management system based on the energy blockchain designed in the article can meet the daily charging needs of electric vehicles, effectively solve the problems of charging privacy leakage of electric vehicle users and the allocation of charging pile resources, and provide a safe and efficient operation mode for the construction and development of charing piles.

Title: Toward better blockchain-enabled energy trading between electric vehicles and smart grids in Internet of Things environments: a survey
Abstract: With the rise of the 3Ds-decarbonization, decentralization, and digitalization-the number of electric vehicles is projected to increase, necessitating the implementation of modern technologies to avoid unnecessary energy wastage. Numerous studies have been developed proposing electric vehicle (EV) charging frameworks in networks empowered by renewable energy resources. In addition, more focus has recently been directed on incorporating blockchain technology to assure security and transparency in trading systems. However, fewer studies have delved into developing a practical implementation of their solution due to the complexity of the topic. Therefore, this paper thoroughly investigates integrating blockchain technology in electric vehicle charging systems, analyzing the existing practical implementation and their characteristics. It comprises 48 relevant studies between 2017 and 2023, covering the following main research areas: (i) renewable energy-based electric charging systems, (ii) blockchain frameworks used in energy trading, and (iii) performance metrics of simulated and implemented solutions. Results show that blockchain applications in EVs and energy trading systems are highly current, and researchers are actively exploring ways to improve their efficiency and effectiveness.

Title: RETRACTED: Blockchain-Enabled Charging Right Trading Among EV Charging Stations (Retracted article. See vol. 13, 2020)
Abstract: Increasing penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) gives rise to the challenges in the secure operation of power systems. The EV charging loads should be distributed among charging stations in a fair and incentive-compatible manner while ensuring that power transmission and transformation facilities are not overloaded. This paper first proposes a charging right (or charging power ration) trading mechanism and model based on blockchain. Considering all kinds of random factors of charging station loads, we use Monte Carlo modeling to determine the charging demand of charging stations in the future. Based on the charging demand of charging stations, a charging station needs to submit the charging demand for a future period. The blockchain first distributes initial charging right in a just manner and ensures the security of facilities. Given that the charging urgency and elasticity differences vary by charging stations, all charging stations then proceed with double auction and peer-to-peer (P2P) transaction of charging right. Bids and offers are cleared via double auctions if bids are higher than offers. The remaining bids and offers are cleared via the P2P market. Then, this paper designs the charging right allocation and trading platform and smart contract based on the Ethernet blockchain to ensure the safety of the distribution network (DN) and the transparency and efficiency of charging right trading. Simulation results based on the Ethereum private blockchain show the fairness and efficiency of the proposed mechanism and the effectiveness of the method and the mechanism.

Title: Design of Energy Block Chain System Supporting Electric Vehicle Charge and Discharge Trading
Abstract: As one of the underlying supporting technologies of Energy Internet, energy blockchain has attracted more and more attention. How to combine energy blockchain with specific application scenarios is a difficult problem in current research. Firstly, the technical feasibility of the application of energy blockchain in the field of energy trading is analyzed in detail. Then, taking the scenario of electric vehicle charging and discharging trading as the breakthrough point, considering the convenience and security of both sides of the transaction, a blockchain system framework supporting consensus algorithm and intelligent contract is proposed, which includes blockchain layer and intelligent contract. There are four layers of architecture: extension layer, application layer and presentation layer. Finally, from the perspective of system platform development, the technical connotation and application demonstration based on ethereum architecture are introduced. The system architecture and its application effect provide technical reference for promoting the integration of energy system and information technology and improving energy efficiency.

Title: Privacy-preserving blockchain-based electric vehicle charging with dynamic tariff decisions
Abstract: Electric vehicles are gaining widespread adoption and are a key component in the establishment of the smart grid. Beside the increasing number of electric vehicles, a dense and widespread charging infrastructure will be required. This offers the opportunity for a broad range of different energy providers and charging station operators, both of which can offer energy at different prices depending on demand and supply. While customers benefit from a liberalized market and a wide selection of tariff options, such dynamic pricing use cases are subject to privacy issues and allow to detect the customer's position and to track vehicles for, e.g., targeted advertisements. In this paper we present a reliable, automated and privacy-preserving selection of charging stations based on pricing and the distance to the electric vehicle. The protocol builds on a blockchain where electric vehicles signal their demand and charging stations send bids similar to an auction. The electric vehicle owner then decides on a particular charging station based on the supply-side offers it receives. This paper shows that the use of blockchains increases the reliability and the transparency of this approach while preserving the privacy of the electric vehicle owners.

Title: Exploiting Blockchain for Smart Charging of Electric Vehicles: A Proof of Stake Algorithm
Abstract: The energy sector is undergoing a vast transformation. Innovations in renewable energy production, electric vehicles (EVs) and smart meters are pushing the energy sector towards decentralisation. In this context, determining the potential of distributed ledger technology (DLT) through smart contracts and interoperability between different sections of the grid is an open point. Implementation of blockchain as a DLT into the electricity distribution network with the combination of multiple components, assists decentralisation and the connection of end-users directly to the grid. In this paper, a new method is proposed to charge EVs based on fuzzy logic and distributed ledger using a proof of stake algorithm. In this way, the risk of manipulation and loss of data, which could be detrimental to the energy sector, is reduced. The decentralisation of controlling EV's charging is achieved using this technique and the data floating inside the network is immutable and protected by the consensus mechanism of blockchain.

Title: Privacy-Preserving Electric Vehicle Charging for Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading Ecosystems
Abstract: The proliferation of renewable energy systems and high-capacity batteries has enabled customers to trade their excess energy on the market in a peer-to-peer manner through the smart grid. At the same time, electric vehicles (EVs) are enjoying widespread acceptance, leading to a higher demand for charging stations. In this paper, we propose a system where energy traders and EV owners collectively work to satisfy the energy demands of EVs. Specifically, energy traders make bids to EV owners who, in turn, reserve their preferred charging station for a specific period of time. To protect the privacy of EV owners, we also introduce an anonymous payment system that cannot link individual owners to specific charging locations. Finally, to guarantee the security and transparency of the entire system, we store all transactions on a consortium blockchain that is managed by the energy traders and the financial institutions that support the anonymous payment system. Our experimental results indicate that the overhead of the cryptographic operations involved in the major transactions is low, in terms of both computational and communication cost.

Title: A Novel Framework for Monitoring Solar PV based Electric Vehicle Community Charging Station and Grid Frequency Regulation using Blockchain
Abstract: To reduce vehicle emissions and to save the depleting fuel resources, Electric Vehicles (EVs) are gaining more attention due to low operating cost and less carbon footprint. The Renewable Energy Sources (RES) such as Solar PV can be suitably used for fulfilling the high energy demands of EVs. In addition, EVs can be used to provide ancillary services such as energy storage, spinning reserve, frequency and voltage regulation for Grid-connected environment. The major challenge is to develop EV charging station integrated with RES, Grid Power and Information Communication Technologies (ICT) in order to provide these ancillary services. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework for monitoring solar PV based EV community charging station and load frequency regulation using Blockchain technology. In addition, we propose Smart Energy Management Controller (SEMC) which optimally decides the EV charge and discharge operation by considering the present capacity, frequency of the Grid and solar PV availability. We integrate Blockchain technology with the SEMC to record EV owner information, energy status and financial transactions while fulfilling different requirements viz; Owner privacy, data immutability, energy data transparency, tracking and availability with the improved trust among the users. The key features of the proposed framework are analysed.

Title: Toward a unified framework for electric vehicle infrastructure: Insights into charging management, communication and emerging technologies
Abstract: The transportation sector remains a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and the widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is a key strategy for mitigating this impact. However, scaling EV adoption requires an equally robust expansion and integration of charging infrastructure, which currently suffers from fragmented management systems and incompatible communication protocols. This paper systematically reviews the existing landscape of EV infrastructure, identifying gaps in charging efficiency, grid integration, and user accessibility. Through an analysis of EV simulation platforms, communication standards, and central management systems, we synthesize key insights into a unified framework that leverages emerging technologies such as blockchain, AI-driven optimization, and reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we propose strategies for enhancing scalability, including EV unification, gamification, and adaptive charging mechanisms. By providing a structured roadmap, this study serves as a comprehensive guide for researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders, offering actionable insights to optimize the EV ecosystem and accelerate the shift toward sustainable transportation.

Title: A Blockchain Construct for Energy Trading against Sybil Attacks
Abstract: In recent years, vehicular networks have been drawing special attention because of its significant potential role in the future smart city. Safety is a crucial status in vehicular networks, especially in energy trading where security of transactional data and safety against critical attacks is of most concern. The Sybil attack is one where an adversary can create multiple fake identities, become a part of the P2P network and try to manipulate the decision of the entire network in accordance to his own will. Thus in view to enhance the security of system, this paper focuses on a Sybil attack mitigation method based on blockchain and it's Proof of Work (PoW) consensus. Also a framework of automated privacy-preserving selection of charging stations (CS) based on pricing and the distance to the electric vehicle (EV) is presented. A blockchain based approach increases the transparency between EV and CS while preserving the privacy of the EV owners.

Title: Synergistic Integration of Blockchain and Software-Defined Networking in the Internet of Energy Systems
Abstract: Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading, Smart Grids (SG), and electric vehicle energy management are integral components of the Internet of Energy (IoE) field. The integration of Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) and Blockchain (BC) technologies into the IoE domain offers potential benefits that have only been studied in the literature in a few works. In this paper, we investigate the state-of-art solutions that leverage both SDNs and blockchain within the realm of the IoE. We categorize these solutions based on the method of integrating SDN and BC into two categories. The first category is the blockchain for SDN, where blockchain enhances the SDN directly. The second category is blockchain and SDN, where both technologies are used to enhance the proposed solutions. We identify three distinct blockchain applications based on their usage: decentralizing the SDN control plane, serving as a decentralized platform, and improving security measures. Similarly, we observe that SDN serves as a performance enhancer, a substitute for traditional networking, and solely as a control and management framework. It is posited that integrating SDNs and blockchain into IoE leads to performance enhancements, improves security, enables decentralized operations, and eliminates single points of failure in the SDN control plane. Additionally, some unaddressed issues, such as energy efficiency, smart contract management, and scalability, are discussed as potential future directions.

Title: Consensus Based Mechanism Using Blockchain for Intensive Data of Vehicles
Abstract: The explosive development of Intelligent Vehicles (IVs) has led to a complex network, which is difficult to manage due to the extensive communication of vehicles and storage of vehicles' data. Due to increase in number of vehicles, IVs come up with large difficulties. Huge data generated by IVs is very difficult to be handled due to limited storage and lack of intelligent management. Many security and privacy problems are also related to the IV networks. Traditional centralized approaches are used to deal with limited storage and security issues. Increasing number of vehicles expand the number of links in network and also leads to the intensive data. Lack of coordination of vehicles, reliability of the network and traffic among vehicles are some of the major issues. These issues hinder the performance of the vehicle industry. We propose a consensus based mechanism using blockchain technology to manage the intensive data and authenticate the data of vehicles in the EV industry. This mechanism also ensures data privacy, security and also promotes data immutability. The transactions are stored in distributed ledger to provide facility of transparency. In a nutshell, blockchain technology is incorporated in EVs sector to revolutionize the World.

Title: A Lightweight Identity Privacy Protection Scheme For Electric Vehicles Based On Consortium Blockchain
Abstract: As electric vehicle (EV) utilization in energy trading expands, protecting user identity privacy during transactions has become a critical area of research. Current privacy protection schemes face significant challenges, including the risks of identity leakage, insufficient protection against double signatures, and low verification efficiency. To address these challenges, this document proposes a lightweight identity privacy protection scheme based on blockchain technology from the consortium. The scheme introduces an improved linkable ring signature algorithm, which guarantees identity anonymity while effectively preventing double signature attacks. In addition, this paper develops a batch aggregation signature and verification algorithm designed to significantly improve verification efficiency in highly concurrent environments. Theoretical analysis and simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms existing solutions in security, computational efficiency, and communication overhead. Compared to existing solutions, this approach provides substantial improvements, making it a promising approach to secure user privacy within the rapidly evolving domain of EV energy trading.

Title: Sustainable management of electric vehicle battery remanufacturing: A systematic literature review and future directions
Abstract: The increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and the corresponding surge in lithium-ion battery (LIB) production have intensified the focus on sustainable end-of-life (EOL) management strategies (i.e., reuse, repurpose, remanufacture, and recycle). This paper presents a systematic literature review of the entire remanufacturing process of LIBs, aiming to offer a cohesive perspective on the approach that reduces the environmental impact of LIB waste by prolonging their lifecycle for reuse in their original EV applications. It reveals major issues from EOL collection to renewed batteries, clustering results into six research streams, and proposes a research agenda to develop integrative, data-driven models that incorporate technical, economic, and environmental considerations. Key findings highlight the need for standardised, non-damaging joining techniques, enhanced safety protocols for disassembly, and scalable cathode re-functionalisation methods. Recommendations include leveraging advanced technologies such as AI, machine learning, IoT, and blockchain to optimise remanufacturing processes and enhance supply chain transparency and efficiency. This comprehensive review aims to foster the development of sustainable remanufacturing practices, contributing to the circular economy and supporting the growth of the EV industry.

Title: A Survey of Blockchain Applications in the Energy Sector
Abstract: As our fossil fuel reserves are rapidly depleting, there has been an increased focus to explore the utility of renewable energy (e.g., solar energy and wind energy) in replacing fossil fuel. One resulting trend is the energy market gradually shifting toward a distributed market, where renewable energy can be traded, partly evidenced by the number of blockchain-based solutions designed for the (distributed) energy sector. The interest in blockchain is also due to blockchain's underpinning characteristics such as anonymity, decentralized, and transparency. Therefore, in this article, we perform a comprehensive review of how blockchain technology has been, and can be, deployed in energy applications, ranging from energy management to peer-to-peer trading to electric vehicle-related applications to carbon emissions trading, and others. We also study the existing architectures and solutions, and existing and emerging security and privacy challenges, as well as exploring other potential applications of blockchain in the energy sector.

Provides insights into driver identification for EV safety and comfort, and analyzes the economic viability of DWC for the EV ecosystem.Abstract The rapid advancement and adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitate innovative solutions to address integration challenges in modern charging infrastructure. Dynamic wireless charging (DWC) is an innovative solution for powering electric vehicles (EVs) using multiple magnetic transmitters installed beneath the road and a receiver located on the underside of the EV. Dynamic charging offers a solution to the issue of range anxiety by allowing EVs to charge while in motion, thereby reducing the need for frequent stops.

Title: Contract based Energy Blockchain for Secure Electric Vehicles Charging in Smart Community
Abstract: The smart community (SC), as an important part of the Internet of energy (IoE), can facilitate integration of distributed renewable energy sources (RES) and electric vehicles (EVs) in the smart grid. However, due to the potential security and privacy issues caused by untrusted and opaque energy markets, it becomes a great challenge to optimally schedule the charging behaviors of EVs with distinct energy consumption preferences in SC. In this paper, we propose a contract based energy blockchain for secure EV charging in SC. Firstly, a permissioned energy blockchain system is introduced to implement secure charging services for EVs with the execution of smart contracts. Secondly, a reputation based delegated Byzantine fault tolerance (DBFT) consensus algorithm is proposed to efficiently achieve the consensus in the permissioned blockchain. Furthermore, based on the contract theory, the optimal contracts are analyzed and designed to satisfy EVs' individual needs from energy sources while maximizing the operator's utility. Finally, numerical results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme through comparison with other conventional schemes.

Title: A review on peak shaving techniques for smart grids
Abstract: Peak shaving techniques have become increasingly important for managing peak demand and improving the reliability, efficiency, and resilience of modern power systems. In this review paper, we examine different peak shaving strategies for smart grids, including battery energy storage systems, nuclear and battery storage power plants, hybrid energy storage systems, photovoltaic system installations, the real-time scheduling of household appliances, repurposed electric vehicle batteries, uni- and bi-directional electric vehicle charging, the demand response, the time-of-use pricing, load shedding systems, distributed generation systems and energy-efficient management. We analyze the potential of each strategy to reduce peak demand and shift energy consumption to off-peak hours, as well as identify the key themes critical to the success of peak shaving for smart grids, including effective coordination and communication, data analytics and predictive modeling and clear policy and regulatory frameworks. Our review highlights the diverse range of innovative technologies and techniques available to utilities and power system operators and it emphasizes the need for continued research and development in emerging areas such as blockchain technology and artificial intelligence. Overall, the implementation of peak shaving strategies represents a significant step toward a more sustainable, reliable and efficient power system. By leveraging the latest technologies and techniques available, utilities and power system operators can better manage peak demand, integrate renewable energy sources, and create a more reliable and secure grid for the future. By discussing cutting-edge technologies and methods to effectively manage peak demand and incorporate renewable energy sources, this review paper emphasizes the significance of peak shaving strategies for smart grids as a crucial pathway towards realizing a more sustainable, dependable and efficient power system.
